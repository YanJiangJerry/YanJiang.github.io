I am currently a Master student at <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au" target="_blank"> The University of Queensland (UQ)</a>, where I did my bachelor in computer science from 2019 to 2022 and master of data science from 2022 to 2023 supervised by Doctor Quihong Qiu and Professor Helen Huang <a href="http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/huang/" target="_blank">

I am now doing research on nature language processing teached by Doctor Ruihong Qiu.

I speak Mandarin and English.

Best Wishes!
