姜彦 /`Jerry/

I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au" target="_blank"> The University of Queensland (UQ)</a>, where I did my Bachelor of computer science and Master of data science degrees in UQ supervised by <a href="http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/huang/" target="_blank"> Professor Helen Huang</a> and graduated at 16 Dec 2023.

My research focuses on graph neural networks (GNNs) and natural language processing (NLP).

Best Wishes!
